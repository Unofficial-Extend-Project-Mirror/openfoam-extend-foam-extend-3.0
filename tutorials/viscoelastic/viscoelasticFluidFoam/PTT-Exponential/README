#+TITLE: *PTT-Exponential viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 3.1*
#+AUTHOR: Jovani
#+DATE:  05 October 2010



* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the Exponential form of
  the Phan-Thien-Tanner constitutive model (PTT-Exponential).
  The simulation is about the flow past by a cylinder.

*** This is only an illustrative case for the PTT-Exponential constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver. Some adjustments can improve the results, once the mesh
    used was coarse to make the simulation more fast.

*** The parameters for constitutive model was obtained from:
    VERBEETEN, W. M. H.; PETERS, G. W. M.; BAAIJENS, F. P. T. Viscoelastic analysis
    of complex polymer melt flows using the extended pom-pom model. Journal
    of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, v. 108, n. 1-3, p. 301-326, 2002.
