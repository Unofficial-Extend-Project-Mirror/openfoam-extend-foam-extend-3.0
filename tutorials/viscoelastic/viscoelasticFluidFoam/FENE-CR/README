#+TITLE: *FENE-CR viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 3.1*
#+AUTHOR: Jovani
#+DATE:  05 October 2010



* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the Finitely
  Extensible Nonlinear Elastic Chilcott-Rallison constitutive model (FENE-CR).
  The geometry was the 5:1 3D plane contraction, considering 1/4 of the real
  geometry.

*** This is only an illustrative case for the FENE-CR constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver.

*** Some results using this model with a 2D 4:1 plane contraction can be found at:
