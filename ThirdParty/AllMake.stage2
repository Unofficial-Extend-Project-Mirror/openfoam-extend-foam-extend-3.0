# Script
#     AllMake.stage2
#
# Description
#     Build script for ThirdParty packages: Stage2
#
#     Communication libraries
#
#     Once this stage is built, you would normally re-initialize your
#     foam-extend environment in order redirect foam-extend toward the 
#     appropriate communication library 
#
#     NOTE: This stage is optional. Use it only if you want to override 
#           your system communication libraries
#
# Requirements:
#     1: Your foam-extend environment must be properly initialized
#     2: AllMake.stage1 if you are overriding your system compiler
#
# Author:
#     Martin Beaudoin, Hydro-Quebec, (2010)
