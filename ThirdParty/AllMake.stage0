# Description
#     Build script for ThirdParty packages: Stage0
#
#     Populate the local RPM vault
#
#     NOTE: This stage is optional. Use it only if you want to move some RPMs
#           to the appropriate location for your architcture so the other stage scripts
#           will be able to pick them up
#
#     Usage: ./AllMake.stage0 file_1.rpm file_2.rpm ... file_n.rpm
